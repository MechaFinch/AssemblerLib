	A general purpose format for relocatable object code
	Version ...14
	
	The goal of this specification is a simple method for linking libraries. A relocatable ovject
	file should be able to do the following:
		- Relocate references to arbitrary positions in memory
		- Allow references to other relocatable object files
	
File Sections
	Relocatable Object Files consist of, in order:
	-	A Header, describing various parameters
	-	A number of relocation tables, indicated by the Header field Relocation Table Count
	-	The object code of the library
	
	Each relocation table consists of, in order:
	- A table header, describing its type and size
	- A number of table entries, indicated by the table header field Entry Count

	Header
		Name						#Bytes		Values (hex)	Description
		Magic Number				4			69 42 04 14		Indicates version number (and silliness)
		Endianness					1			0, 1			Little endian, Big endian respectively
		Section Size Width (SSW)	1			--				Number of bytes for numbers indicating the size of file segments
		Object Code Size			SSW			--				Number of bytes of code
		Library name length			1			--				Length in bytes of Library Name
		Library Name				^			--				Name of the library described by this file
		Relocation Table Count		1			--				Number of relocation tables
		<Relocation Table Pointers>
		<Relocation Tables>
		<Object Code>
	
	Relocation Table Pointer
		Name						#Bytes		Values (hex)	Description
		Pointer						SSW			--				Offset in bytes, from the start of the file, to a relocation table
	
	Outgoing Relocation Table Header
		Outgoing tables describe the location of references defined in this library.
		To determine the value placed at an incoming reference, these references are searched.
		
		Name						#Bytes		Values (hex)	Description
		Table Type					1			0				Indicates this table is outgoing
		Entry Address Width (EAW)	1			--				Number of bytes for the address, relative to the start of the object code, of each reference
		Entry Count 				SSW			--				Number of entries in this table
		<Outgoing Relocation Table Entries>
		
	Outgoing Relocation Table Entry
		Name						#Bytes		Values (hex)	Description
		Entry Name Length			1			--				Number of bytes of Entry Name
		Entry Name					^			--				Name of this reference
		Entry Value					EAW			--				Address, relative to the start of the object code, for this reference

	Absolute Incoming Relocation Table Header
		Incoming tables describe where outgoing references, from this file or others, are placed in
		the object code of this file. Each entry consists of its own sub-table of Entry Values,
		which indicate each position the reference is to be placed.
		
		As an Absolute incoming relocation table, the value placed at the incoming reference is of
		fixed size and the exact value of the position of the outgoing reference.
		
		Name						#Bytes		Values (hex)	Description
		Table Type					1			1				Indicates this table is absolute incoming
		Entry Address Width (EAW)	1			--				Number of bytes for the address, relative to the start of the object code, of each reference
		Physical Address Width		1			--				Number of bytes for the absolute address placed at each reference in the table
		Entry Count					SSW			--				Numebr of entries in this table
		<Incoming Relocation Table Entries>
	
	Fixed Relative Incoming Relocation Table Header
		Incoming tables describe where outgoing references, from this file or others, are placed in
		the object code of this file. Each entry consists of its own sub-table of Entry Values,
		which indicate each position the reference is to be placed.
		
		As a Fixed Relative incoming relocation table, the value placed at the incoming reference
		is of fixed size and is relative to some offset from the first byte of the value.
		
		Name						#Bytes		Values (hex)	Description
		Table Type					1			2				Indicates this table is fixed relative incoming
		Entry Address Width (EAW)	1			--				Number of bytes for the address, relative to the start of the object code, of each reference
		Relative Offset				1			--				Offset in bytes from the first byte of the placed value, used to determine the relative value. Must be signed.
		Physical Address Width		1			--				Number of bytes for the relative address placed at each reference in the table
		Entry Count					SSW			--				Number of entries in this table
		<Incoming Relocation Table Entries>
	
	Variable Relative Incoming Relocation Table Header
		Incoming tables describe where outgoing references, from this file or others, are placed in
		the object code of this file. Each entry consists of its own sub-table of Entry Values,
		which indicate each position the reference is to be placed.
		
		As a Variable Relative incoming relocation table, the value placed at the incoming reference
		is of variable size and is relative to some offset from either the first byte or last byte
		of the value. Additionally, each possible value width may place a fixed value before the
		relative value. The address of the incoming reference is the address of the first byte of
		the relative value, regardless of the fixed value's presence.
		
		Name							#Bytes		Values (hex)	Description
		Table Type						1			3, 4			Indicates this table is variable relative incoming. A value of 3 indicates the offset is relative to the first byte of the value; a value of 4 indicates the offset is relative to the last byte of the value
		Entry Address Width (EAW)		1			--				Number of bytes for the address, relative to the start of the object code, of each reference
		Relative Offset					1			--				Offset in bytes from the first or last byte of the placed value, used to determine the relative value. Must be signed.
		Prefix Size	(PS)				1			--				Number of bytes of the fixed value prefixing each relative value
		Physical Address Width Count	1			--				Number of possible physical address widths
		<Physical Address Width Table Entries>
		Entry Count						SSW			--				Number of entries in this table
		<Incoming Relocation Table Entries>
		
	Physical Address Width Table Entry
		Name							#Bytes		Values (hex)	Description
        Physical Address Width          1           --              Number of bytes for the relative address
		Prefix							PS			--				Value to prefix this physical address width with
	
	Incoming Relocation Table Entry
		This format is used for all variations on incoming relocation tables
		
		Name						#Bytes		Values (hex)	Description
		Entry Name Length			1			--				Number of bytes of Entry Name
		Entry Name					^			--				Name of the reference to place at each entry value
		Entry Value Count			SSW			--				Number of entry values
		<Entry Values>
		
		Entry Value					EAW			--				Address, relative to the start of the object code, for the reference to be placed at
